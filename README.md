# Federated-Learning-In-Healthcare

## Background
To the best of my knowledge, this is the first list of federated deep learning papers in healthcare. There are couple of lists for federated learning papers in general, or computer vision, for example [Awesome-Federated-Learning](https://github.com/chaoyanghe/Awesome-Federated-Learning). In this list, I try to classify the papers based on the common challenges in federated deep learning. I believe this list could be a good starting point for FL researchers in Healthcare. 

## Criteria

1. A list of **top federated deep learning papers** published since 2016.
2. Papers are collected from peer-reviewed journals and high reputed conferences. However, it might have recent papers on arXiv. 
3. A meta-data is required along the paper, e.g. topic.
4. Some fundamental papers could be listed here as well. 

*List of Journals / Conferences (J/C):*

- **[Medical Image Analysis (MedIA)](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/medical-image-analysis/)**
- **[IEEE Transaction on Medical Imaging (IEEE-TMI)](https://ieee-tmi.org/)**
- **[IEEE Transaction on Biomedical Engineering (IEEE-TBME)](http://tbme.embs.org/)**
- **[IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (IEEE-JBHI)](http://jbhi.embs.org/)**
- **International Conference on Information Processing in Medical Imaging (IPMI)**
- **International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI)**
- **International Conference on Medical Imaging with Deep Learning (MIDL)**
- **IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)**
